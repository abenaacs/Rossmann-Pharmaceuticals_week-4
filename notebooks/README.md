# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Dataset

This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Rossmann Pharmaceuticals dataset. The goal of this analysis is to understand the underlying patterns in the data, identify correlations, visualize trends, and detect any data quality issues before building predictive models.

## Purpose of the Notebook

- **Data Overview**: Provides an initial summary of the data, including column types, missing values, and basic statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifies important features and suggests potential transformations or new features.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigates correlations between numerical features to understand which variables influence sales.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following libraries installed before running this notebook:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies by running the following:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Key Points to Modify:

1. **Dataset File Paths**: Make sure the paths to the dataset files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `store.csv`) match the location of these files in your environment.
2. **Section Descriptions**: Each section should be detailed with descriptions of what the notebook does. You can add further details based on your actual EDA workflow.
3. **Visualization Examples**: If you generate any specific plots or graphs in your notebook, describe those in the README for context.
4. **Requirements**: Include any additional libraries specific to your notebook (e.g., `scipy`, `plotly` if you use them for advanced visualizations).
